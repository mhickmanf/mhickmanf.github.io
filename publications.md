## RESEARCH

[RESEARCH ASSISTANT](http://jonccal.people.clemson.edu/research.php#) | Clemson University | Clemson, SC | August 2019 - Current
```markdown
While achieving my MS, I am working on research at Clemson University under Dr. Jon Calhoun 
as my thesis advisor. I have researched various topics under Lossy Compression, including 
power consumption, huffman encoding on GPUs, and data visualization.

[RESEARCH ASSISTANT](https://www.coastal.edu/computing/facultystaff/lanl-ccucollaboration/#d.en.140722) | [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov/projects/ultrascale-systems-research-center/staff-interns.php) & Coastal Carolina University | Los Alamos, NM & Conway, SC| Aug. 2017 - Aug. 2019
```markdown
I was hired as a research assistant to work with Dr. William Jones' research with LANL.
This work had a primary focus on data analytics for HPC resilience, exposing me to tools 
including R, Python, ElasticSearch, and Apache Spark.

My first year of research used capabilities from ElasticSearch and our own methods to develop
a means to match source code lines with messages written to various HPC system logs. This 
research led me to an invitation for a summer internship at LANL in 2018, which resulted in 
a scholarly publication at the 2018 IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability 
Engineering Workshops (ISSREW). 

The second year of research dealt with using Apache Spark and Python to ingest and filter 
events from multiple different logs to assist in the understanding of a HPC machine's health. 
This research resulted in another summer internship at LANL and a presentation at 
Supercomputing 2019.
