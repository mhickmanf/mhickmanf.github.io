Currently I am an Research Assistant for [Jon Calhoun](http://jonccal.people.clemson.edu/) of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Clemson University. I obtained a Bachlor's Degree in Computer Science from Coastal Carolina University, doing research for [William M. Jones](https://www.coastal.edu/academics/facultyprofiles/science/computingsciences/williammjonesjr/) and [USRC and Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov/projects/ultrascale-systems-research-center/staff-interns.php). At Clemson, my research will be involved in Data Compression. Take a look at my other interests and past research projects to learn more!
